# Introduction

The manual for the Wirra language, with descriptions of behaviour,synatax, instructions and datatypes.
The Wirra language is a procedural language designed to enforce a rigid separation between functions and data. It is also designed to prevent ambiguity and prevent common programming mistakes.
Code written in Wirra is first compiled into bytecode by the compiler, then the interpreter runs the bytecode. Control of the interpreter and compiler is handled by the Wirra CLI.
